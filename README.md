#Design of CMOS Based Inverter using SKY130 open-pdk

This repository targets the designing of a cmos based inverter with the sky130 nm technology. In this we will be again discussing the basics of MOSFETS ( both n-MOS and p-MOS ) with the standard 1.8 V standard models. I will keep on updating it on regular basis adding more details to it.

As previously we have discussed about the basic 1.8V transistors in a separate repository, Here we start our discussion with the concept of transmission of strong and weak signals.
